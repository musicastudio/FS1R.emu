# The noise formant, read off the hardware

The unvoiced operator was the last part of the engine with no measurement anywhere in it. A cascade of `1 + skirt` one-poles whose cutoff spanned nine octaves from 20 Hz, ring modulated up to the centre, with a level term that held the RMS constant: a reading of the patent, fitted against nothing. It read 7.1 to 7.4 dB out in level over eighty-one segments and 3.8 to 6.4 dB out in band shape, the largest gap left in the engine.

`13_unvoiced3`, recorded 2026-09-21, settles it. Every unvoiced segment recorded before it put the band at a 1 kHz centre, and from bandwidth 40 up the band's lower edge sits at DC, so both earlier takes stop widening at about 1750 Hz and both plateau in level at the same bandwidth. That is a band folding on itself, not a law, and it hid the top half of the range. At an 8 kHz centre nothing folds until the band is 16 kHz wide.

All three laws below are read rather than modelled.

## The corner is linear in the bandwidth register, and it clamps

Fitting a two one-pole band to each of the twenty-five bandwidths recovers a corner that is flat in `fc / register`:

| register | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 36 | 41 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| fitted corner, Hz | 203 | 263 | 342 | 418 | 500 | 624 | 733 |
| Hz per register | 20.3 | 17.6 | 17.1 | 16.7 | 16.7 | 17.3 | 17.9 |

So `fc = 17 Hz * register`, a straight line through the origin. `NOISE_BASE_HZ * 2^(register / 127 * NOISE_OCT)` gave 20 Hz at register 0 and 10 kHz at the top and was the wrong shape over the whole range.

**It stops at register 77.** Every spectrum from sysex bandwidth 60 up is the same band at the same level: 29.6 to 29.75 dB over ten settings, the same widths, the same shape. Sysex 60 is register 77.

**And it is an absolute width in hertz**, which the two earlier takes had already said without being read. `05_unvoiced_1` is at note 60 and `05b_unvoiced2` at note 36, two octaves apart, and the width does not move: 108 Hz against 102 at bandwidth 4, 1509 against 1389 at 40, 1781 against 1819 at 64. The same question the formant window fell into twice, answered the same way, by a second value of the variable.

## The skirt multiplies the corner

The engine gave the skirt a cascade of `1 + skirt` one-poles, which makes the band **narrower** as the skirt opens. The unit makes it wider. Fitted corner at bandwidth 20, over the eight settings:

| skirt | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| corner, Hz | 418 | 553 | 690 | 951 | 1235 | 1736 | 2442 | 3367 |

That is 8.06 over seven steps, so 1.35 a step. Half-power width follows it, 662 Hz to 1775 at a 1 kHz centre where the engine went 940 down to 243.

**The skirt also moves the level, and by a different law.** At bandwidth 60 the skirt lifts the total 29.94 to 42.19 dB over its eight settings; at bandwidth 20 it does nothing at all, 43.64 to 43.81. Both fall out of one rule: each skirt step reads like a register 5.5 lower on the level table below. At register 77 that walks back up the falling part of the table and is worth twelve decibels; at register 25 the table is already flat there and the skirt cannot move it.

## The level is a table

Total output against the bandwidth register, with the band's own RMS normalised out:

| register | 0 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 36 | 41 | 46 | 51 | 56 | 61 | 67 | 72 | 77+ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| dB | -19.9 | -0.30 | -0.07 | 0.00 | -0.36 | -1.11 | -1.77 | -2.77 | -3.63 | -4.69 | -6.07 | -7.65 | -9.41 | -12.17 | -14.24 | -15.14 |

Flat to a tenth of a decibel from register 5 to 20, then fifteen decibels of fall, then a floor. Nothing analytic fits both ends: a power law in the corner is monotone where this is flat and then steep, and the engine's constant-RMS normalisation is the flat part alone. So the engine carries the measurement on a five-register grid and interpolates, the way it already carries `FRMDET`, `FEGLVL` and `EG_KEYOFF`.

**Register 0 is not on that curve.** The unit puts the noise twenty decibels under the flat region there, where the engine sounded a full band.

## The resonance is a threshold

Voice byte `res` adds a carrier beside the band. Measured at bandwidth 20, an 8 kHz centre:

| res | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| half-power width, Hz | 674 | 598 | 715 | 668 | 381 | 64 | 64 | 64 |
| total, dB | 43.76 | 43.87 | 43.78 | 43.69 | 43.95 | 44.60 | 45.74 | 46.87 |

Settings 0 to 3 are the same spectrum to the byte. 4 narrows it. 5, 6 and 7 are a tone with the noise under it, 64 Hz being the analysis floor. Reading the rises as `1 + d^2` against a band at unit RMS gives the carrier amplitude directly: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.21, 0.46, 0.76, 1.02. The engine's `res / 7` ramp had the tone taking over from setting 2 and added twelve decibels across the range where the unit adds three.

## What the demo settled that the capture set could not

Bandwidth register 0 silences the noise. Whether it also takes the resonance carrier down with it is not in any recording: every segment the set has at bandwidth 0 is at resonance 0 too.

Demo song 6, Kalimba, answers it. Its patch runs six unvoiced operators and two of them sit at bandwidth 0 with resonance 5 and 7 at levels 99. Taking the carrier down with the noise costs that song **5.88 dB of band tilt**; leaving it at the table's own level costs **1.94**, and nothing else in the fifteen moves by a digit. The capture set does not move either, to every digit, which is what says the demo is reading the one thing the set is blind to rather than absorbing an error.

## Where it stands

| file | level before | level after | shape before | shape after |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `05_unvoiced_1` | 7.40 | **0.67** | 3.77 | 3.31 |
| `05_unvoiced_2` | 2.86 | **0.94** | 6.36 | 3.65 |
| `05b_unvoiced2` | 7.13 | **0.55** | 4.06 | 3.16 |
| `13_unvoiced3` | 6.15 | **0.61** | 2.96 | **1.23** |

The level is settled. What is left is band shape at a 1 kHz centre, 3.2 to 3.7 dB against 1.23 at 8 kHz, and it is one thing: **the unit carries a wideband pedestal the two-pole cascade rolls off too hard.** Band by band on `ubw-64`, hardware minus engine, with each side's own level divided out:

| octave | 125-250 | 250-500 | 500-1k | 1k-2k | 2k-4k | 4k-8k | 8k-16k |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| dB | -1.81 | -1.66 | +0.52 | +0.01 | -0.57 | +4.22 | +10.08 |

The core matches inside 0.6 dB and everything above 4 kHz is short. The width measurements say the same thing from the other side: the half-power width saturates near 1500 Hz while the twenty-decibel width keeps opening past 9 kHz, which is a narrow core on a broad pedestal and not any `1/(1 + (f/fc)^2)^N`. That is the same energy STATUS.md's "top octave" item has been chasing, and a file that sweeps the bandwidth at an 8 kHz centre with the analysis reaching to Nyquist is what would model it.

## 2026-09-22, the pedestal is the second pole, and the noise is averaged two samples at a time

The 2026-09-21 reading above put two identical one-poles on the band and left a wideband pedestal it could not model. Refitting every hardware segment with the two poles free settles it: the band is two digital one-poles in series whose coefficients are **not the same**, and the pedestal is the second pole's own floor. A digital one-pole at coefficient `a` passes `(a / (2 - a))^2` of everything at Nyquist, which is white, sits at the same level whichever centre the band is moved to, and rises with the register twelve decibels an octave, all three of which the pedestal does.

Fitting `a1`, `a2` and a peak gain to each spectrum, ring modulated to the centre and multiplied by the roll-off below, over 200 Hz to 23 kHz:

| register | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 36 | 41 | 46 | 51 | 56 | 61 | 67 | 72 | 77 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `a1` | .0030 | .0066 | .0095 | .0154 | .0236 | .0272 | .0348 | .0353 | .0399 | .0479 | .0520 | .0571 | .0566 | .0615 | .0605 |
| `a2` | .071 | .080 | .097 | .106 | .114 | .136 | .161 | .203 | .241 | .285 | .372 | .453 | .690 | .880 | .973 |
| peak, dB | -8.2 | -10.4 | -11.7 | -14.1 | -16.4 | -17.7 | -19.7 | -20.8 | -22.5 | -24.6 | -26.7 | -29.0 | -31.9 | -34.4 | -35.3 |
| rms, dB | 0.90 | 0.77 | 0.78 | 0.86 | 0.75 | 0.78 | 0.74 | 0.75 | 0.77 | 0.69 | 0.80 | 0.64 | 0.66 | 0.67 | 0.65 |

Three things fall out of the numbers. The first pole is linear in the register to about 55 and then stops. The second doubles every sixteen registers from 25 up, `2^((reg - 25) / 16)`, until it reaches 1 at the clamp, which is where the band becomes one pole wide and the "pedestal" reaches the core. And the peak falls one `LEVEL_DB` per register, -0.376 dB, from register 25 to 77 to the decibel, so the level table of 2026-09-21 was this line seen through the width.

**It is the same band at every centre.** The 1 kHz take gives `a1` .0162, .0361 and .0628 at registers 20, 41 and 77 against .0154, .0353 and .0605 here, `a2` .106, .207 and .994 against .106, .203 and .973, and the peak -14.2, -20.9 and -35.7 against -14.1, -20.8 and -35.3. The 4 kHz and 8 kHz centres at register 51, skirt 2 agree to 6 % and 0.4 dB. That is two files, three centres and two dates, so the coefficients are measured rather than fitted.

**The skirt is two controls, not a register shift.** At register 25 a skirt step multiplies `a1` by 1.20 and `a2` by 1.285 and takes 0.84 dB off the peak, which is the "5.5 registers a step" of the earlier reading. At register 77 `a2` is already 1 and the skirt multiplies `a1` by 1.40 a step with the peak flat. At 51 it is 1.315 and 1.135. The engine carries the three slices and interpolates between them.

**The noise is averaged two samples at a time.** On every wideband segment the unit's noise is flat to 8 kHz and then falls 2.8, 6.8, 13 and 27 dB at 12, 16, 20 and 23 kHz against a white band. The same curve comes off `15_filter`'s source at a 1 kHz centre and `13_unvoiced3`'s at 8 kHz, so it is after the ring modulator, and `01_reference`'s fixed sines read the same level at 22 kHz as at 55 Hz, so it is the unvoiced path alone. A two-sample mean, `cos^2` of half the angular frequency with its null at Nyquist, lands on it at 0.8 dB rms over forty bins. Computing the band at 24 kHz and holding it was tried and is wrong: it folds the 8 kHz band onto 16 kHz at -6 dB, and the unit has nothing there.

Where it stands, band shape as rms over sixth-octave bands from 100 Hz within 40 dB of the peak, which is the metric `tools/analyze_capture.py`'s does not use: its sixth-octave bands below 100 Hz hold one or two FFT bins each and sit at the recording's floor, and on these files they carry most of its number.

| file | shape before | shape after | level scatter before | after |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `05_unvoiced_1` | 2.65 | **1.19** | 0.40 | 0.18 |
| `05_unvoiced_2` | 1.42 | **0.70** | 0.23 | 0.19 |
| `05b_unvoiced2` | 2.91 | **1.55** | 0.57 | 0.14 |
| `13_unvoiced3` | 2.23 | **0.61** | 0.23 | 0.17 |
| `15_filter`, source | 2.16 | **0.52** | 0.04 | 0.03 |

The resonance carrier's table was read against a band whose RMS the engine had at `1 / sqrt(3)` of what it assumed, the uniform noise it ran on; the noise source is unit variance now and the table is scaled by `sqrt(3)`, which keeps the three recordings and Kalimba where they were. The tone still scatters 3 dB between the two takes in opposite directions at settings 5 and 7, so its law against the register is not read.

Reproducing this: `python tools/fit_noise_band.py` prints the table above off `captures/hardware/`.

## 2026-09-24, the pedestal is closed and the shape number is the metric

Read again against the current engine, octave bands of hardware minus engine with each side's level divided out, over eleven wideband segments across `05_unvoiced_1`, `13_unvoiced3` and `05_unvoiced_2`: -0.5 to +0.5 dB in every octave from 125 Hz to 16 kHz, the 4 to 8 kHz and 8 to 16 kHz bands included. The two-pole reading above had already closed it. The 3.1 to 3.7 dB that `tools/analyze_capture.py --compare` still prints as shape for the 1 kHz files is its sixth-octave bands under 100 Hz, one or two FFT bins each at the recording's floor on one side and the render's on the other; the same files over 100 Hz read 1.9 to 2.2, and over the bands within 40 dB of the peak 1.2 to 1.6. A gate on those bands was tried in the analyzer and taken out, because it also empties the files whose spectra are three lines. The number is the metric's, not the engine's, and it is left as it is so the ledger stays comparable.

What is left in the unvoiced chain is the resonance carrier's level against the register, which the two takes still put 2 to 3 dB apart in opposite directions at settings 6 and 7. Not a shape, and not above 4 kHz.
