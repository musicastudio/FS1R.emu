// INFERRED. The CPU side is read from the firmware, including the cutoff and both resonance
// conversions, so what is modelled here is only what the chip does with a coefficient. Measured
// 2026-09-21 by the 15_filter capture: the three lowpasses are taps off one 4-pole ladder and HPF,
// BPF and BEF a 2-pole state variable filter, which is what the unit reads at 24, 18 and 12 dB per
// octave and 12 on the highpass. docs/filter.md carries the working.
//
// Included by fs1r/internal.h, which Chan needs for its VFilter.
