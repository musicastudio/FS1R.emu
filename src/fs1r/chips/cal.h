// INFERRED. Neither custom chip has public register documentation, so what they do with a register
// value is modelled. Most of these start as models from the DX7 lineage (same design family), the
// formant synthesis patent or the Data List, and are replaced by a measurement as recordings arrive.
// A few carry "(demo)": those are fitted to rgwan's recording of the built-in demo, which is real
// hardware but a coarse reference, fifteen songs of mixed patches with their effects in the path.
// The capture set is what settles any of them properly.
//
// They all live here so calibrating against a recording is one table edit rather than a hunt through
// the engine. Names match STATUS.md's INFERRED list, and docs/findings.md carries the working behind
// each measurement.
//
// A value here is a claim about the hardware, so it is changed by measuring, never by taste. A number
// fitted against one recording is not measured: three conclusions in two days were written up with a
// residual quoted and all three turned out wrong the same way. See the 2026-09-19 modulation index
// entry in docs/findings.md.
//
// Facts read off the board are in fs1r/hardware.h. Knobs that are ours rather than the hardware's,
// and which must never change the output, are in fsvr/tuning.h.

// kHz against the engine's white band, the same curve at a 1 kHz centre (15_filter) and an 8 kHz one
// (13_unvoiced3), so it sits after the ring modulator. A two-sample mean, cos^2 of half the angular
// frequency, lands on it at 0.8 dB rms over forty bins; a sine at 22 kHz on the voiced path reads the
// same level as one at 55 Hz, so it is the unvoiced path alone.
// The unvoiced resonance adds a carrier beside the band, and it is a threshold rather than a ramp.
// MEASURED: settings 0 to 3 give the same spectrum to the byte, 4 narrows it, and 5, 6 and 7 are a tone
// with the noise under it, the total rising 0.8, 2.0 and 3.1 dB over setting 0. Reading those rises as
// 1 + d^2 against a band at unit RMS gave 0.21, 0.46, 0.76 and 1.02, and the engine then set the carrier
// against a band whose RMS was actually 1 / sqrt(3), the uniform noise it ran on. The table below is the
// same carrier against the band's true RMS, sqrt(3) times the reading, which keeps what the three
// recordings and Kalimba settled. The tone still scatters 3 dB between the 8 kHz take at register 25
// and the 1 kHz take at register 51, in opposite directions at settings 5 and 7, so its law against the
// register is not read yet. The engine's res / 7 ramp had the tone taking over from setting 2 and added
// 12 dB across the range where the unit adds 3.
// MEASURED 2026-09-24, 22_ures: five bandwidth registers by the four settings that carry a tone, at 8 kHz,
// left channel only (the recording's right channel lags the left by one sample, which costs a mono sum
// 1.25 dB at 8 kHz). The carrier is a sine to the sample (envelope cv 0.003 at register 10, setting 7)
// and its amplitude against the band's RMS depends on the register as much as on the setting: 1.50 at
// register 10 where it is 2.37 at 87. And the noise under it is not left alone: a narrow band loses
// 23 dB of noise at setting 7 where a wide one loses nothing. Both are read together, interpolated
// across the register and clamped outside 10..87; settings 0 to 3 are the plain band (13_unvoiced3).
// The whole take, tone and noise alike, sits 1.1 dB over the engine at 8 kHz, as 13_unvoiced3 does,
// and that offset is the noise level's own against the centre frequency, not this table's: the DC is
// against the unit's band and the noise column is relative to setting 4.
// ponytail: the noise loss is a gain; the unit also reshapes the band (the centre drops more than the
// skirts at register 10), which a gain cannot see. The 8 kHz take cannot say whether the carrier scales
// with the centre frequency.
